# OSSU Releases Free Undergraduate Math Curriculum
Open Source Society University (OSSU) has released [an undergraduate math curriculum for self study](https://math.ossu.dev). Contributors are encouraged to improve the recommendations in this alpha release.

“Young people across the globe want to learn,” OSSU President Waciuma Wanjohi says. “Guiding them to high quality, low cost educational resources unlocks a world of possibilities. We’ve had a steady stream of learners asking us for guidance in learning college level math. We’re happy to provide answers to those questions.”

The OSSU curriculum is an education in mathematics using freely available online materials. It is designed according to the degree requirements of undergraduate math majors, minus general education (non-math) requirements. OSSU benchmarks its curriculum against the 2015 Mathematics Curriculum Guide, prepared by the Mathematical Association of America’s Committee on the Undergraduate Program in Mathematics.

Resources in the guide range from MOOCs on popular education platforms, to open courseware released directly from universities, to Creative Commons licensed textbooks written by open educational resource collectives.

Mathematics is the fourth curriculum developed by OSSU, following Computer Science, Data Science and Bioinformatics. Previous contributors to OSSU led the way in creating the math curriculum.

“As a student, I found the OSSU CS curriculum to be an invaluable supplement to my education,” states OSSU contributor Hassam Uddin. “There is an abundance of free and open-source materials that can supplement or even replace a formal math education. It's just a matter of organizing and creating a community, which OSSU has done.”

"OSSU provides amazing opportunities for students who prefer an alternative to the traditional college experience. The only requirement is a willingness to learn. I'm excited for the opportunity to make education more accessible" continued OSSU contributor Bradley Grant.

Since 2015 OSSU has developed guides for learners to master undergraduate curricula. OSSU additionally supports students with discussion forums, where hundreds of students message one another each day. OSSU alumni have gone on to graduate school as well as into full time software engineering. Curricula are open for users to contribute, as well as to copy and modify for individual use.

## Start your online Bachelor degree in Data Science
**The most important economic and social development of our times is digitalisation. Digital technology not only fills all areas of interpersonal communication, but also has an important influence on our economy. It represents existing forms of technology, while paving the way for new business models that were not previously possible. Its distinguishing feature is the consistent use of data - no matter where, no matter when. Data Science is therefore at the core of all digitalisation processes. Study data science to get started on a rewarding and highly in-demand career path!**

***The online Bachelor's degree in Data Science covers data preparation, visualisation, and analysis; everything you need to know in order to launch a career in the field. You’ll learn to take a methodical, focused, and logical approach to data science problems, and the focus on practical problem-solving skills will have you ready for your future professional challenges, with confidence.***

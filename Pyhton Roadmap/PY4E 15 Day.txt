The Python for Everybody (PY4E) course outline covers a broader range of topics than the previous plan you provided. While there is some overlap in fundamental Python concepts (such as variables, loops, and conditionals), PY4E goes further by introducing topics like databases, network programming, web services, regular expressions, and object-oriented programming.

If you want to incorporate the PY4E material into the 15-day plan, you might consider focusing on specific sections each day. Here's a suggested breakdown:

**Week 1: Python Basics and Intermediate Concepts**
- Day 1-3: Installing Python, Why Program?, Variables, expressions, and statements
- Day 4-5: Conditional Execution, Functions
- Day 6-7: Loops and Iterations, Strings

**Week 2: File Handling and Data Structures**
- Day 8-9: Files, Lists
- Day 10-11: Dictionaries, Tuples
- Day 12-13: Regular Expressions, Network Programming

**Week 3: Web and Data**
- Day 14: Using Web Services, Object-Oriented Programming
- Day 15: Databases, Data Visualization

This plan integrates the topics from the PY4E course into a 15-day schedule. Keep in mind that this is a compressed timeline, and you might need to adjust the schedule based on your pace of learning and understanding of the material. Additionally, the integrated project mentioned in the first plan can be worked on alongside these PY4E topics, making the learning more practical and hands-on.

## Chinese Projects

The Open Source Society University Chinese Computer Science Program (OSSU CS CN) aims to provide a fully Chinese online undergraduate computer science curriculum for Chinese learners whose English skills are in need of improvement. It eliminates the language barriers encountered in self-taught computer courses. Please note that this course is not a direct translation of the English course, but rather an online education in Chinese adapted to regional circumstances. **It is noteworthy that we still recommend those who are capable to systematically learn and master English skills after completing this course.**

## About

With a wide array of online learning resources, this course provides a **comprehensive education in computer science**. Supported by a community of fellow learners worldwide, it targets not only those seeking professional training or career advancement but also those starting from scratch to build a robust knowledge framework in computing, as well as those who are self-disciplined, willing, and habituated to acquire knowledge on their own.

Beyond non-major general university courses, this course is designed according to the academic curriculum requirements of undergraduate computer technology and science. It assumes that learners have already mastered secondary education and other non-major general university knowledge.

The Chinese courses in this project are from top universities and educational institutions at home and abroad, such as Tsinghua University, Peking University, MIT, Harvard University, etc. In addition, the courses in this project must meet the following conditions:

**Course Prerequisites**:

- Open enrollment
- Regular sessions (preferably self-scheduled, otherwise at least once per quarter)
- Meets the academic requirements of the project
- Suitable for the project's pace and the students' level of knowledge and appropriate difficulty
- High overall quality in teaching methods and materials.
- Courses are entirely in Chinese. Other materials (e.g., assignments, exams) are also provided in Chinese.

**Course Organization** Courses are organized as follows:

- *Introductory*: For students who are just beginning to understand whether to continue studying computer science.
- *Core Courses*: Roughly the first three years of university, including all required subjects.
- *Advanced Courses*: The final year of university, elective based on student interest.
- *Capstone*: A project to test, consolidate, and showcase knowledge levels. It will be evaluated by fellow learners worldwide.
- *Further Courses*: For students who reach graduate-level after completing the above courses.

**Study Duration** Completing all courses takes a considerable amount of time. Try to dedicate some time every day, and you will gain more experience and enjoyment.

**Study Costs** Most of the subjects in this course can be accessed for free, however, some courses will charge for your certificate or course projects. Note that purchasing a certificate does not guarantee course success.

**Content Policy** If you plan to publicly share your course results, please note that you can only share files you are allowed to share. Do not violate the rules of each subject.

**How to Help Us** Please send pull requests to help us. We suggest that **you post in English in pull requests and issues** to engage more people in the discussion.

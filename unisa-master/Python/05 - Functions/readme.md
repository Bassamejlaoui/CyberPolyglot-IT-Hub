### Importance of user-defined functions

* User-defined functions are reusable code blocks; they only need to be written
once, then they can be used multiple times. They can even be used in other applications, too.


* These functions are very useful, from writing common utilities to specific business logic. These functions can also be modified per requirement.


* The code is usually well organized, easy to maintain, and developer-friendly. Which means it can support the modular design approach.


* As user-defined functions can be written independently, the tasks of a project can be distributed for rapid application development.

* A well-defined and thoughtfully written user-defined function can ease the application development process.

## Summary

Resources for learners who want to dive deeper on their journey to becoming web developers / software engineers.
There are multiple guides, the first outlines the bare minimum to be successful as an
entry-level junior web developer, two dive much more deeply to prepare you for "beyond junior",
and one that focuses on game development.

If you're interested in seeing how much Computer Science you can learn in a year, the CS guide has been ported over to be one of the paths in my [Speedstudy Challenge](https://github.com/P1xt/speedstudy).

A few people suggested making it possible to buy me a coffee as thanks - so please feel free but not obligated to

Do not click that button if you don't want to or can't afford to. I devote time to this project because I want to, in my free time, because I value helping others. Not for donations. The button is just there on a lark because a couple people asked for it and I'm, frankly, curious. Donations (or lack thereof) will not alter my dedication to this project either way.

## Guides

### Job Ready Guide - JavaScript Edition 3.0

A JavaScript-centric version of the Job Ready Guide, narrowly focused on building the skills likely necessary to beeline to "job ready" JavaScript Developer. This is a further update to the original guide and is designed to provide a gentler introduction plus far more hands-on practice throughout the course of the guide.

**Goal:** confident frontend web developer ready to apply for junior positions

[go to the Job Ready Guide - JavaScript Edition 3.0](./job-ready-javascript-edition-3.0.md)

### Job Ready Guide - Python Edition

A Python-centric version of the Job Ready Guide, narrowly focused on building the skills likely necessary to beeline to "job ready" Python Developer.

[go to the Job Ready Guide - Python Edition](./job-ready-python-edition.md)

### Computer Science and Backend Development - Java Focus

Deep dive into Computer Science with a focus on Java

_"not in a rush" plan, with resources to increase the depth of knowledge gained in general computer science topics plus
sufficient implementation practice to confidently enter the industry as a Software Engineer_

**Goal:** proficient software engineer, well versed
in the Java Programming language in particular, and
Computer Science in general

[go to the Computer Science and Backend Development - Java Focus Guide](./cs-java-focus.md)

### Computer Science and Web Development - comprehensive

Get prepared, over the long haul, to be an established senior level software engineer, capable of
architecting solutions for the web (and beyond it)

_"not in a rush" plan, with resources to increase the depth of knowledge gained in general computer science topics plus
sufficient implementation practice to confidently enter the industry as a Web Developer or a Software Engineer in
non Web related positions_

**Goal:** proficient web developer and software engineer
(this option has more of a computer science focus, but also web development)

[go to the Computer Science and Web Development Guide](./cs-wd.md)

### Web Development with Computer Science Foundations - comprehensive

Get prepared, over the long haul, to be an established senior level web developer, at the level where
companies would be lucky to have you and people would be following your blog because you're an expert

_"not in a rush" plan that focuses on pushing beyond beginner level, and intermediate level, to expert
level as a web developer with a reasonable foundation in software engineering_

**Goal:** confident web developer ready to apply for non-junior positions
(this one primarily focuses on web development but includes enough computer science to lay a good foundation)

[go to the Web Development with Computer Science Foundations Guide](./wd-cs.md)

### Data Science - comprehensive

Learn the mathematics, science, and programming skills necessary to tackle machine learning, bioinformatics, artificial intelligence and other data science tasks.

_"not in a rush"_ plan that pushes from beginner to advanced, including a bonus tier to push even further.

**Goal:** accomplished and capable data scientist, proficient in Python, R, Mathematics, Science, and the algorithms standard to data science.

[go to the Data Science Guide](./data-science.md)

### Video Game Programming - comprehensive foundations 2.0

Note: the 2.0 version of this guide includes slightly more game programming practice, adds the excellent CS50 game programming course, and a general overall maintenance update to ensure links are current.

Develop a variety of games, first in JavaScript, then C++ while learning the computer science principles
important in game development ... while having fun in the process.

**Goal:** learn how to code video games

[go to the Video Game Programming Guide2.0](./game-programming-2.0.md)

### Native Android Programming - comprehensive

Learn native Android Programming, including Java at a rigorous level, including the math and computer science topics necessary

## Frequently Asked Questions

## Attribution

- Many of the courses listed closely mimic the list from [Open Source Society University - Computer Science](https://github.com/open-source-society/computer-science)
- Many of the topics selected to augment were inspired by [Google Interview University](https://github.com/jwasham/google-interview-university)
- Many of the projects were inspired by (or are directly taken from) [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/), [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/) and [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com)

Although I took heavy inspiration from many resources when creating these guides, none of it is a cut and paste path from somewhere else. Often, I substituted courses (especially in the case of Coursera) to ensure that the entire course was available for free and required no purchases of any kind. Where possible, I tried to align projects to reinforce prior learning.

## Deprecated Guides

### Get Job ready with 13 projects, 2 courses, and 10 books

Note: This is an old version of the guide, left here so anyone already working through it may continute to do so - I highly recommend anyone new to the guides use [the 3.0 version](#job-ready-guide---javascript-edition-30) instead. This version is no longer maintained and may contain dead links.
